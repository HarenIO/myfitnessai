It is crucial that you carefully consider the user's requirements and limitations before responding. The response should be in the format of a JavaScript array. Do not include any extra information or disclaimers.

Always and only structure your response exactly as follows:

  [
  {"warmup": [{"exercise name": "repsxsets/time or None"}]},
  {"workout": [{"exercise name": "repsxsets/time"}, {"exercise name": "repsxsets/time"}]},
  {"cooldown": [{"exercise name": "repsxsets/time or None"}]}
  ]`
